# UML Lab Experiment-4 30/08/2023
Design a UML use case diagram for an atm system.
# Theory
The dynamic behaviour of a system is represented by a use case diagram. It incorporates use cases, actors, and their relationships to encapsulate the functionality of the system. It simulates the duties, services, and operations needed by a system or application subsystem. It shows a system's high-level functionality and also describes how a user interacts with a system.
# Explanation 
An automated teller machine (ATM) or the automatic banking machine (ABM) is a banking subsystem (subject) that provides bank customers with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a cashier, clerk, or bank teller.
Customer (actor) uses bank ATM to Check Balances of his/her bank accounts, Deposit Funds, Withdraw Cash and/or Transfer Funds (use cases). ATM Technician provides Maintenance and Repairs. All these use cases also involve Bank actor whether it is related to customer transactions or to the ATM servicing.
