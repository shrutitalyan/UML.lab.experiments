Design a UML use case diagram for an atm system.
# Theory
The dynamic behaviour of a system is represented by a use case diagram. It incorporates use cases, actors, and their relationships to encapsulate the functionality of the system. It simulates the duties, services, and operations needed by a system or application subsystem. It shows a system's high-level functionality and also describes how a user interacts with a system.
# Explanation 
An automated teller machine (ATM) or the automatic banking machine (ABM) is a banking subsystem (subject) that provides bank customers with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a cashier, clerk, or bank teller.
Customer (actor) uses bank ATM to Check Balances of his/her bank accounts, Deposit Funds, Withdraw Cash and/or Transfer Funds (use cases). ATM Technician provides Maintenance and Repairs. All these use cases also involve Bank actor whether it is related to customer transactions or to the ATM servicing.

Design a UML sequence Diagram for the Railway ticket booking system
# Theory
Sequence Diagrams â€“ A sequence diagram simply depicts interaction between objects in a sequential order i.e. the order in which these interactions take place. We can also use the terms event diagrams or event scenarios to refer to a sequence diagram.
# Explanation
This is the UML sequence diagram of Railway Management System which shows the interaction between the objects passenger, railway system, tickets
